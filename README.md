Please develop a simple book management API using Node JS. The API
should offer these functionalities:
    User authentication.
    CRUD operations for managing book entries (e.g., title, author,
publication year).
    Filtering books by author or publication year.
    Clear documentation of API endpoints and their usage.
    Implementation of basic security measures (like input validation).
